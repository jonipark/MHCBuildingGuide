# MHC Building Guide
➡️ Directional assistance for classrooms, cafeterias, and study spaces in school

## The inspiration for the project

I attend Mount Holyoke College, a college with many historical old buildings. In particular, there is an academic building that links four distinct halls.

Each hall has a separate entrance, making it challenging to locate the correct building and floor. Consequently, it is common for freshmen and sophomores to arrive late to their class on the first day of the semester as they struggle to find their classrooms.

Moreover, locating cafes, pubs, grab-n-go spots, and ✨ **study areas** scattered throughout various buildings can be equally difficult. I have witnessed some friends remain unaware of these facilities until their second year in college. I wanted to enhance accessibility to the campus's diverse resources and locations for students and faculty.

Therefore, I decided to develop an AR app to help Mount Holyoke College students and faculty navigate the campus more efficiently. The application will support both outdoor and indoor navigation.
